When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd use a remote when working with other people, create a backup of the
    repo, or just want to publish my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git always pulled automatically, there's a chance that commits from the
    remote conflict with my local changes, before I'm ready to review changes
    between the local and the remote repos.
